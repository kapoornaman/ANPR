# Automated Number Plate Recognition Using EASYOCR and OPENCV
ANPR technology revolutionizes license plate detection and recognition, vital in law enforcement, traffic, and security. This review delves into recent advancements, particularly emphasizing deep learning techniques for character recognition. It explores critical components such as plate localization, character segmentation, and OCR. Additionally, the paper addresses challenges, performance metrics, and future directions aimed at enhancing accuracy and efficiency in practical settings. By synthesizing existing research and identifying emerging trends, this review contributes to the broader adoption of ANPR systems in various domains, including traffic management, law enforcement, and security surveillance.

Advanced technology, including machine learning and image processing, is essential for efficient traffic management and surveillance due to the surge in vehicle traffic.
Computer systems equipped with these capabilities reduce the need for human resources and handle tasks such as vehicle counting, parking violation detection, database management, and alerting for blacklisted or stolen vehicles.Traditional methods like inductive loops and sensors are costly, cumbersome, and challenging to maintain and install, necessitating modernized approaches for road accident monitoring and management. Robust license plate recognition systems are more efficient, enabling the identification of vehicles and their owners from vehicle images. ANPR systems play a crucial role in toll collection, speed regulation, and proper traffic management by detecting and identifying license plates.
 The core steps of an ANPR system include number plate area detection, character breakdown, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), where characters are separated for recognition.
 Numerous research papers have been reviewed to gather data on ANPR-centered applications.
